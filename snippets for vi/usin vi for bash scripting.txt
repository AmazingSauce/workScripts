when using vi you can hit esc :r to read something in

for example you can create a file with a generic script or code and do 
:r ./if

this will load the file into your current file

you can also read in commands 
:r !date

#Tue, Nov 25, 2014  4:41:04 PM
# you can input the date with :r! date "+\%x\%X" or :r! date


you can create a script 

:map <f2> i#This file was created on <ESC>:r!date "+\%x\%X" <ESC>kJ

this create the line then adds the date on the line below after execiting insert mode, k then moves it up and capital J combines the line below

you can then add that to the .vimrc file
map <f2> i#!/bin/bash<ESC>
map <f3> i#This file was created on <ESC>:r!date "+\%x\%X" <ESC>kJ
